# Credit Card Default Prediction
## Project Overview
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of credit card default. The objective is to develop a model that can accurately forecast whether a credit card holder will likely default on their payments based on their historical data.

## Introduction
Credit card default prediction is a crucial task in the financial industry for managing risk and making informed decisions. This project involves analyzing historical credit card data to build a predictive model that can help identify high-risk customers.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project is sourced from the UCI Credit Card Default Dataset. It contains information about credit card holders, including:

Demographic Information: Age, gender, education level, marital status.
Credit History: Credit limit, bill statement history, payment status.
Target Variable: Whether the customer defaulted on their credit card payments.
## Requirements
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries:

pandas
numpy
scikit-learn
matplotlib
seaborn

## Usage
Load the Dataset: Import the dataset into your Python environment.
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the data, including handling missing values and encoding categorical features.
Model Training: Train a machine learning model using the preprocessed data.
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
## Results
The model's performance metrics, including accuracy and other evaluation measures, are detailed in the results.md file. This provides insights into how well the model predicts credit card defaults.

## Future Work
Explore advanced feature engineering techniques.
Experiment with different machine learning algorithms and hyperparameter tuning.
Implement methods for model interpretability to understand feature importance and model decisions.
